- add support to run multiple replicates
- add support of running protein only simulations
- better choice of atoms for Boresch restraints based on interactions
- add flat-bottom restraint aside from Boresch to have a well-defined binding site
- add supports and documentation to build membrane protein systems without dabble.
- correction for symmetry.
- error reporting based on blocks

BUG
- during analysis if one component fails, the results is reported without it instead marking failure.
